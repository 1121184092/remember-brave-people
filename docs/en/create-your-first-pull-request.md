Paste into the **original file box**, before the right bracket (`]`), then modify the coordinate, color and GitHub ID in it. **VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- **Paste into the original box, NOT the two "Propose changes" boxes!!! The position pointed by the red arrow below!!!**
- **Find an available coordinate (x,y), otherwise your PR will be rejected. (You don't like your tile overwritten by other people, right?)**
- **Pick up your favorite color, or use the same as others if you don't know how.**
- **Replace with your GitHub ID, not your real name or nickname, otherwise your PR will be rejected.**

Click `Propose Changes` button.
